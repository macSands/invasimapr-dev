invasimapr is an R package to assess species and trait invasiveness and site
invasibility by visualising trait dispersion and computing invasion fitness.
The package implements a network invasibility framework that decomposes
invasion fitness into abiotic suitability, niche crowding and resident
competition components, enabling spatially explicit predictions of
establishment probability for potential invaders.

The core workflow consists of eight steps:

1. **Prepare inputs** -- assemble community, trait and environmental matrices
   from occurrence data.
2. **Simulate invaders** -- generate hypothetical invader trait profiles by
   resampling resident traits.
3. **Trait space and crowding** -- compute Gower-based trait space, convex
   hull membership and niche crowding.
4. **Resident modelling** -- fit generalised linear mixed models to resident
   abundance and derive standardised predictors.
5. **Sensitivity estimation** -- estimate trait-dependent slopes for abiotic
   suitability, crowding and competition.
6. **Invader prediction** -- project invaders into the resident model space.
7. **Invasion fitness** -- compute per-invader, per-site invasion fitness
   under multiple model options (A--E).
8. **Establishment probability** -- map fitness to establishment probability
   using probit, logistic or hard-threshold transforms.

## Installation

You can install the development version of invasimapr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/macSands/invasimapr-dev) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("macSands/invasimapr-dev")
```

## Example

A minimal example of the invasion fitness workflow:

``` r
library(invasimapr)

# Step 1: Prepare inputs from occurrence, trait and environmental data
fit <- prepare_inputs(
  occ_long  = my_occurrences,
  trait_wide = my_traits,
  env_wide   = my_environment
)

# Step 2: Simulate hypothetical invader profiles
fit <- simulate_invaders(fit, n_inv = 50, method = "columnwise")

# Step 3: Trait space and crowding
fit <- prepare_trait_space(fit)

# Step 4: Model resident abundances
fit <- model_residents(fit)

# Step 5: Learn trait-dependent sensitivities
fit <- learn_sensitivities(fit)

# Step 6: Predict invader predictors
fit <- predict_invaders(fit)

# Step 7-8: Compute invasion fitness and establishment probability
fit <- predict_establishment(fit, option = "C")

# Summarise invasiveness and invasibility
fit <- summarise_results(fit)
```
